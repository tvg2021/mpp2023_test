The problem of continuous machine learning is studied. Within the framework of the game-theoretic
approach, no assumptions are used when calculating the next forecast about the stochastic nature of the
source that generates the data stream – the source can be analog, algorithmic or probabilistic, its parameters
can change randomly points in time, when constructing a prognostic model, only structural assumptions are 
used about the nature of data generation. An online forecasting algorithm for a locally stationary time series
is presented. An estimate of the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is obtained. The conducted numerical
experiments illustrate the obtained estimates of the regret of the algorithm.
